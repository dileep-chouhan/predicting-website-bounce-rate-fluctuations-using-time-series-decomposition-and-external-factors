# Predicting Website Bounce Rate Fluctuations Using Time Series Decomposition and External Factors

## Overview

This project aims to improve website user experience by predicting fluctuations in website bounce rate.  We achieve this through time series analysis, decomposing the bounce rate into its constituent components (trend, seasonality, residuals) and incorporating external factors that might influence bounce rate, such as marketing campaigns or website updates. The predictive model allows for proactive identification and mitigation of periods of high bounce rate, leading to potential improvements in user engagement and conversion rates.

## Technologies Used

* Python 3.x
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Statsmodels (or other relevant time series library)


## How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and install the required Python packages using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run the Analysis:** Execute the main script using:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

   Ensure that your data is correctly placed as specified within the code (likely a CSV file).


## Example Output

The script will print key analysis results to the console, including details about the time series decomposition (trend, seasonality, residuals), model performance metrics (e.g., RMSE, MAE), and potentially forecasts.  Additionally, the script will generate several plot files visualizing the bounce rate, its decomposition, and potentially the model's predictions.  These plots (e.g., `bounce_rate_decomposition.png`, `bounce_rate_forecast.png`) will be saved in the project directory.  The specific output files and their names might vary depending on the implemented model and visualization choices.


## Data

The project requires a CSV file with time series data for website bounce rate.  The exact format and required columns should be specified in the `main.py` or a separate data preparation script.  Consider including a sample dataset for demonstration purposes.
